1. Implement a module pdfo, and then newuoa_mod etc as submodules. Use the solvers by

use, non_intrinsic :: pdfo_mod, only : newuoa
use, non_intrinsic :: pdfo_mod, only : RP, IK

2. Let COBYLA receive bounds and linear constraints directly. Offer an option to respect bound.

3. Let LINCOA receive bounds directly. Offer an option to respect bounds.

4. Offer a subroutine called `pdfo`, which behaves similarly as the function `pdfo` in
MATLAB/Python. It should be accessible by

use, non_intrinsic :: pdfo_mod, only : pdfo

5. Make subroutines trstep (maybe others) available to users by

use, non_intrinsic :: pdfo_mod, only : trstep

It should solve unconstrained/bound-constrained/linearly-constrained trust region subproblems.
