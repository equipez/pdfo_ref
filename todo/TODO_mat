1. When the MATLAB version is implemented (e.g., newuoa_mat), we may remove the 'matlab/interfaces/' directory,
and put its content directly below matlab/

20230108: put the MEX files under newuoa_for, and name them ast newuoa_for_dgm, etc? What about gethuge?
githuge is used only in preprima and maxint, the latter again only used in preprima.

2. Make newuoa etc unavailable to the end users. (?)

3. 20230128: Check what happens with
cobyla(macup('LHAIFAM'))
The classical version works well, but not the new one.
Update: cobylb.f90 has been updated to improve the modernized COBYLA on this problem. Yet its
performance is still inferior compared to the classical one.

4. The infos (exitflags) should be returned from a function, not to hard code them.
