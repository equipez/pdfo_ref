This folder contains the intersection-form version of the Fortran source
files. The files in this folder are generated by the interform.m script,
and they are NOT intended to be readable.

This project is coded in the free form, yet some platforms accept only
fixed-form Fortran code, for example, the MATLAB MEX on Windows. The code
in this folder can serve such a purpose.

In the intersection form, each continued line has an ampersand at column
73, and each continuation line has an ampersand at column 6. A Fortran file
in such a form can be compiled both as fixed form and as free form.

See http://fortranwiki.org/fortran/show/Continuation+lines for details.
