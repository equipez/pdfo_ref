This is a module providing a modern Fortran implementation of the NEWUOA
algorithm described in 

M. J. D. Powell, The NEWUOA software for unconstrained optimization
without derivatives, In Large-Scale Nonlinear Optimization, eds. G. Di
Pillo and M. Roma, pages 255--297, Springer, New York, US, 2006

Coded by Zaikun Zhang (www.zhangzk.net) in July 2020 based on Powell's
