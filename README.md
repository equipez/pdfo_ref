This is the reference implementation of Powell's derivative-free optimization solvers,
namely COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA.

This package is part of a research project funded by the [Hong Kong Research Grants Council](https://www.ugc.edu.hk/eng/rgc) and the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk) (PolyU). It is still under intensive development, and
there is no release yet. If you want to use the above-mentioned
solvers, see the [website](https://www.pdfo.net) and [repository](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo) of
PDFO instead.

Dedicated to late Professor [M. J. D. Powell](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html) FRS (1936--2015).
