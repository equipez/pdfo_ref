This is the reference implementation of Powell's derivative-free optimization solvers, 
namely COBYLA, UOBYQA, NEWUOA, BOBYQA, and LINCOA.

This project is under development. There is no release yet. If you want to use the above-mentioned 
solvers, see the [website](https://www.pdfo.net) and [repository](https://github.com/pdfo/pdfo) of 
PDFO instead.

Dedicated to late Professor [M. J. D. Powell](https://www.zhangzk.net/powell.html) FRS (1936â€“2015).
